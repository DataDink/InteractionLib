<header>data-ajax-target</header>
<p>
   The <em>target</em> and <em>data-ajax-target</em> attributes are typically used to redirect a behavior's response or
   output to an element other than the element the behavior is declared on. Not specifying a target will default
   to the element the behavior is declared on.

   This attribute expects a <em>Context Selector</em>.
