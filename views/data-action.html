<header>action / data-action</header>
<p>
   The <em>action</em> and <em>data-action</em> attributes typically specify a uri for an ajax request.
   This can be a relative or absolute uri with or without query parameters.
</p>

<p>
   When used in conjuction with an <em>ajax-form</em> behavior the named inputs of the form will be serialized
   and appended to the uri when using verbs that do not accept a request body. (e.g. get or delete)
</p>
