This is a jQuery plugin library that provides markup-wiring for common ajax and UI interactions.

Requirements:
-------------
* jQuery
* jQueryUI


What it does:
-------------
* At its core it allows you to send an ajax request to the server and post the results on your page or in a modal dialog completely configured in your markup via a minimal amount of data attributes (no javascript needed).
* Can facilitate the wiring of other jquery plugins directly from your markup, also with a minimal amount of attributes.
* Greatly decreases the amount of time it takes to produce interactive pages.
* Greatly decreases the amount of maintenance required for interactive pages.
